  <h1>We use boxes and their associated rules all the time</h1>
  <div class="container">
  <p>Boxes help us treat different elements separately and interact with them in different ways.
    It's easy to notice boxes in different places on websites once you start looking out for them.
    We can see how the html and css code organize websites using boxes with google chrome's inspect
    element feature.

  <div class="container">
  <p>Take a look at the website for the town I'm from- the html and css are clearly marked to show where
    boxes start and end, independently of the content they contain.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container2">
    <p> The area of the website containing all the content below the header is marked as "structural container",
      and the line of code that controls it is marked in red. You can also see it named in the style sheet, shown underneath the html. It
      creates a way to apply rules to only that portion of the site, and has its own borders, margins, and padding.

  <div class="container">
     <p>Even though the code looks a lot more complicated, this is even essential to the way that huge and complicated sites like youtube are designed.

   <div class="container">
    <p>Here is what youtube's website looks like on desktop. Think about which elements of the site would be
      useful to be treated differently from one another in order to guess where the boxes are.
      It's not just deciding which elements physically look like boxes.
    </p>
    </div>

  <div class="container2">
    <p>For example, this is the header highlighted. Do you notice how each clickable element isn't highlighted separately, but rather that the whole group of elements
      has a common box together?
    </p>
    </div>

  <img src="ytplayer.jpeg" alt="the youtube player is now highlighted">

  <div class="container2">
    <p>Even though the code that actually controls the youtube player itself is dealt with separately,
      the youtube player is within a box that keeps it at a consistent position and stores the script for the interactivity.
      It also links to where the video is being stored, which is actually a different link than the one you or I would get by copying
      and pasting the youtube link to one of our friends
